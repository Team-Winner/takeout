              CODE REVIEW
              I'm seeing inconsistent use of virtual paths for your images
              "./image/" here, "image/" later in the file, and even other uses
              in other files. Keep this consistent.  That way, when and if you
              move things around, you're making the same style of change and
              not hunting around for alternatives.

              CODE REVIEW
              Unnecessary use of the nav-bar class here. You can target these <a> tags
              by virtue of them being children of the ul with the link-list class
              that will make your CSS easier to manage
